# Open Cockpit

Electron app + Claude Code plugin for session intention tracking.

## Architecture

- `src/pty-daemon.js` — **PTY daemon**: standalone process managing all terminals ([docs/pty-daemon.md](docs/pty-daemon.md))
- `src/api-server.js` — **API server**: Unix socket API for external process control ([docs/api.md](docs/api.md))
- `src/main.js` — Main process: window, IPC, daemon client, session discovery
- `src/preload.js` — Context bridge (`api` object)
- `src/renderer.js` — CodeMirror 6 live preview editor + session sidebar
- `src/index.html` + `src/styles.css` — Layout, neon red dark theme
- `hooks/` — Claude Code plugin hooks (PID mapping, intention intro, idle/fresh signal detection, intention change notify)
- `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` — Plugin manifest
- `release.sh` — Version bump + marketplace deployment

## Pool management

The app can manage a pool of pre-started Claude sessions. Pool state lives in `~/.open-cockpit/pool.json`.

- **Init**: via UI or API (`pool-init` with size). Spawns Claude sessions via the PTY daemon using `resolveClaudePath()` (finds `claude` binary via `which` + fallback paths).
- **Dead slots**: `reconcilePool()` auto-restarts dead slots on app startup.
- **Offloading**: Idle sessions get offloaded (snapshot + `/clear`). External `/clear` is also detected and saved as offloaded.
- **Destroy**: `pool-destroy` kills all slots and removes `pool.json`.

### Plugin update → pool reinit

After releasing a plugin update (`./release.sh`), the hooks need 1–2 minutes to auto-update via the marketplace. Pool sessions started before the update have stale hooks. To pick up new hooks:

1. Wait 1–2 minutes after release for auto-update
2. Destroy the pool (`pool-destroy` via API or UI)
3. Re-initialize (`pool-init`)

New sessions will have the latest hooks.

## Key paths

- `~/.claude/session-pids/<PID>` — Session ID (written by plugin hook)
- `~/.open-cockpit/intentions/<session_id>.md` — Intention files (created by app on first open)
- `~/.open-cockpit/colors.json` — Directory color overrides ([docs/theme.md](docs/theme.md))
- `~/.open-cockpit/idle-signals/<PID>` — Idle signal files (written by plugin hooks)
- `~/.open-cockpit/pool.json` — Pool state (slots, sizes, session mappings)
- `~/.open-cockpit/offloaded/<sessionId>/` — Offloaded session data (meta.json, snapshot.log)
- `~/.open-cockpit/api.sock` — Programmatic API Unix socket
- `~/.open-cockpit/pty-daemon.sock` — PTY daemon Unix socket
- `~/.open-cockpit/pty-daemon.pid` — PTY daemon PID file

## Dev

```bash
npm start       # Build + run
npm run build   # Bundle renderer only (esbuild)
```

## Releasing

```bash
./release.sh        # auto-increments patch (0.1.0 → 0.1.1)
./release.sh 1.0.0  # explicit version
```

Bumps version in `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` and `EliasSchlie/claude-plugins` marketplace, commits, pushes both. Marketplace has `autoUpdate: true` — new sessions pick up changes automatically. **Run after pushing any hook changes.**

## Dev vs production

- `npm start` — production instance (user's daily driver, don't touch during dev)
- `npm run dev` — dev instance with separate user data dir + "DEV" in title, safe to restart freely
- Both can run simultaneously
- Multiple Claude sessions may run dev instances concurrently from different worktrees

## Worktree setup

A `post-checkout` git hook auto-runs `npm install` + `npm run build` when creating worktrees. No manual setup needed — just `git worktree add` and it's ready.

## Managing dev instances (multi-session safe)

Multiple Claude sessions may work on different worktrees simultaneously. Electron processes inherit the `cwd` of the worktree — use `lsof` to identify and kill only yours.

> ⚠️ **CRITICAL: You MUST `cd` into your worktree/project directory before running the kill/launch command.** The command uses `$(pwd)` to scope which Electron process to kill. Running it from `~` or any other directory risks killing the **production instance** if it was launched from that directory.

**Always use this command to launch** (kills any existing instance first — safe even on first launch):
```bash
DAEMON_PID=$(cat ~/.open-cockpit/pty-daemon.pid 2>/dev/null || echo NONE); lsof -c Electron 2>/dev/null | awk -v dir="$(pwd)" '/cwd/ && $NF == dir {print $2}' | grep -v "^${DAEMON_PID}$" | sort -u | xargs kill 2>/dev/null; sleep 0.5; nohup npm run dev > /dev/null 2>&1 &
```

> ⚠️ `npm run dev` exits immediately while Electron stays running in the background.
> It will *look* like it died — it didn't. Always kill-before-launch to avoid stacking instances.
> The daemon PID is excluded so terminals survive restarts.

**Kill only YOUR worktree's instance:**
```bash
DAEMON_PID=$(cat ~/.open-cockpit/pty-daemon.pid 2>/dev/null || echo NONE); lsof -c Electron 2>/dev/null | awk -v dir="$(pwd)" '/cwd/ && $NF == dir {print $2}' | grep -v "^${DAEMON_PID}$" | sort -u | xargs kill 2>/dev/null
```

**NEVER** use `pkill -f electron`, `killall Electron`, or `grep "cwd.*$(pwd)"` (substring match) — these can kill other sessions' instances or the production app. Always use exact `$NF == dir` matching as shown above.

## Reloading after changes

- **Renderer changes** (`renderer.js`, `styles.css`, `index.html`): `npm run build`, then Cmd+R in the dev window. Terminals survive (daemon keeps them alive).
- **Main process changes** (`main.js`, `preload.js`): kill and restart your dev instance (see commands above). Terminals survive (daemon keeps them alive).
- **Daemon changes** (`pty-daemon.js`): kill daemon (`kill $(cat ~/.open-cockpit/pty-daemon.pid)`), then restart app. This kills all terminals.

## Conventions

- Electron: contextIsolation, sandbox off (preload needs npm packages)
- CodeMirror 6 bundled with esbuild
- Auto-save 500ms debounce, file watching via `fs.watchFile` (polling)
- Plugin version in `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`, marketplace in `EliasSchlie/claude-plugins`
